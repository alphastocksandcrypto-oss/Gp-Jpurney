# MedNav

Static marketing site for MedNav, the Irish medical career navigation platform.

## Pages

| File | Page | Layout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Homepage (v2, the design source for everything else) | Editorial |
| `opportunities/index.html` | Opportunities hub | Editorial, with a combined board |
| `opportunities/jobs.html` | NCHD and consultant posts | Facet rail beside results |
| `opportunities/locums.html` | Locum shifts | Grouped by starting month |
| `opportunities/conferences.html` | Conferences, courses and CPD | Agenda timeline with a CPD planner |

Each page is a single self-contained file. Fonts (Sora, Inter) load from
jsDelivr; everything else is inline, so a page opens straight from disk with no
build step and no server.

The four layouts are deliberately different. The hub is read, so it is
editorial. The three boards are operated, so each is shaped by the variable
that actually decides the choice: post type and specialty for jobs, date and
rate for locums, date and CPD points for conferences.

## Design system

Tokens, type pairing and motion all come from the homepage:

- Display type Sora (600/700/800), body Inter (400/500/600)
- `--deep #0b2e36`, `--mint #14b394`, `--mint-2 #3ed1a8`, `--paper #f7faf8`,
  `--coral #ff7a59`, `--amber #ffc061`
- Shared components: sticky header with backdrop blur, full screen mobile menu
  with focus trap, `.btn` primary/ghost, listing `.card`, filter `.fchip`,
  `[data-reveal]` scroll reveals, grain overlay, back to top, footer
- `prefers-reduced-motion` disables every animation and reveals all content

Colour carries meaning rather than decoration. Across the section, jobs are
mint, locums amber, conferences coral. Within the jobs board, training posts
are mint, non training amber and consultant posts coral. Composition bars in
each hero encode the real make up of that board.

### A note on the duplicated chrome

The header, footer and shared CSS are copied into each page rather than linked,
which follows the homepage's self-contained pattern and keeps every page
openable on its own. It does mean a change to the header has to be made in five
files. When this site gains a build step, the first job is to lift the shared
block into `shared/site.css` and a header partial.

## Content rules

Carried over from the homepage and enforced on every page:

- Listings are aggregated and linked, never hosted. MedNav never receives an
  application.
- Rates appear only where the agency publishes them. They are never estimated,
  and sorting by rate keeps unpublished rates last rather than treating a blank
  as zero.
- Every card names its source.
- Figures shown next to a board level number describe the same board. Where a
  figure is derived from the sample rows, it is phrased so it cannot be read as
  a claim about the full board.
- No em dashes.

## Placeholders to replace before launch

- `https://mednav.ie` and `/og-image.png` in every page head
- The listing arrays (`OPPS`, `JOBS`, `SHIFTS`, `EVENTS`) are sample records
  mirroring the wireframes, not live feeds. Swap them for the aggregation feed
  and remove the "Sample of the live board" badge on the hub.
- Day counts are computed from the browser's current date, so the sample rows
  read as closed or past once those 2026 dates pass.
- Board sizes (142 jobs, 38 locums, 12 events), the composition bars and the
  "rechecked 2 Aug 2026" stamp are static copy.
- `/opportunities/submit`, `/blog/locum-guide-ireland` and the `/tools` links
  are not built yet.
- Homepage testimonial and avatar images are illustrative placeholders.
